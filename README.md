# CP_Appliance_energy_prediction
Appliance energy prediction estimates energy consumption based on historical data, appliance characteristics, weather, and occupancy patterns. Accurate prediction enables better energy management and optimized energy production and distribution, using advanced technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence.


The data_application_energy.csv dataset contains energy consumption data for various household appliances. The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date and time when the energy consumption was recorded

Appliances: The energy consumed by various household appliances in Wh (watt-hours)

Lights: The energy consumed by lighting fixtures in the household in Wh

T1, T2, T3: Temperatures in different rooms in the household in Celsius

RH_1, RH_2, RH_3: Humidity levels in different rooms in the household in %

T_out: The outdoor temperature in Celsius

Press_mm_hg: The pressure in mm of mercury

RH_out: The outdoor humidity level in %

Windspeed: The wind speed in (m/s)

Visibility: The visibility in (km)

Tdewpoint: The dew point temperature in Celsius.

The dataset was collected over a period of several months from a single household. The data was sampled every 10 minutes, resulting in a total of 19,735 observations.

The purpose of this dataset is to enable the development of predictive models that can accurately estimate household energy consumption. Researchers and practitioners in the fields of energy management and machine learning may find this dataset useful for their work.
